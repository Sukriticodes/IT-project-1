        <h3>About Sudoku</h3>
        <p>Sudoku is a popular logic-based number puzzle that challenges players to fill a grid with digits so that certain conditions are met. Although it uses numbers, Sudoku is not a math game — no calculations are needed. Instead, it requires reasoning, logic, and pattern recognition.Sudoku became widely popular in the early 2000s, though its origins trace back to number puzzles in 18th-century Europe and a modern form first published in Japan in the 1980s. Today, Sudoku appears in newspapers, apps, websites, and competitive puzzle events worldwide.</p>

        <h3>Rules to play Sudoku</h3>
        <h4>Sudoku is a logic-based puzzle game with simple but strict rules. Here's how to play:</h4>
        <pre><h4>Objective:</h4>
1.Fill a 9×9 grid with digits 1 to 9 so that:
2.Each row has every digit from 1 to 9 exactly once.
3.Each column has every digit from 1 to 9 exactly once.
4.Each 3×3 box (subgrid) has every digit from 1 to 9 exactly once.</pre>
        <pre><h4>Basic Rules:</h4>
1.No Repetition:
A number must not repeat in any row, column, or 3×3 box.

2.Use Only Digits 1–9:
You can only use digits from 1 to 9 (no letters, symbols, or zeros).

3.Fixed Numbers Can’t Be Changed:
The puzzle starts with some numbers already filled in. These are clues and cannot be erased or changed.

4.Use Logic, Not Guessing:
A well-designed Sudoku puzzle always has one solution that can be reached using pure logic—no guessing needed.

5.Work Through Possibilities:
It helps to look at rows, columns, and boxes to see which numbers are missing and what options are valid for each empty cell.
